First of all, all .cabal files are extracted from 00-index.tar

Those files are checked for dependencies on parsec, list of packages is stored into packages-that-use-parsec.lst

All those packages are then unpacked and built with "-ddump-minimal-imports" enabled. Full combined import list
for all modules of the package is stored into $package.imports

Then, only parsec-related combinators are selected from imports into $package.parsec-imports

Then, full source of the package is lexified (into $package.tokens) and all tokens that are mentioned in $package.parsec-imports are grepped into $package.parsec-tokens.

Then we compute stats:

combined-import-stats.txt: how many times function was imported, parsec2 and parsec3 combined
parsec2-import-stats.txt: ditto, for parsec2 only
parsec3-import-stats.txt: ditto, for parsec3 only

combined-tokens-stats.txt: popularity of parsec-related tokens, parsec2 and parsec3 combined
parsec2-tokens-stats.txt: same, parsec2 only
parsec2-tokens-stats.txt: same, parsec3 only

parsec2-packages.lst: list of packages that use parsec2
parsec3-packages.lst: ditto, for parsec3

Statistics in the repo was computed on 229 packages, others refused to build and I wasn't looking too hard into why.

To try it yourself:
1)Install a separate GHC (to avoid polluting you package database), put it into PATH
2)make; make; make
